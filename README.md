    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    # Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Or on Windows

    **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```sh
    export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
    ```
    *To make this permanent, add the line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or other shell configuration file.*
